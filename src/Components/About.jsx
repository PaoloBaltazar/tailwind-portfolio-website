          </h3>

          <p className="text-base mb-4 lg:text-xl">My journey into programming began with a passion for video games. From a young age, I was captivated by the worlds and stories that video games could create. I remember spending hours playing and imagining how each game was built, fascinated by the idea that lines of code could bring characters and entire environments to life.

I wanted to create something impactful, something that would leave a lasting impression on others, bring joy to them, and bring me fulfillment as well. My love for learning and my interest in video games laid the foundation for my journey into programming.
